# ePortfolio: SQLAlchemy

This repository contains everything necessary to tag along my SQLAlchemy ePortfolio.

## Setup

This ePortfolio uses [Python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). Please follow the installation guide.

If you use any virtual environment (like venv), make sure to activate appropriately. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to achieve that.

As we talk about SQLAlchemy, do make sure to install SQLAlchemy. To do so, just execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Additionaly it is benefitial for you to have a sqlite-Viewer, as we will work with a sqlite database.

Feel free to use any development environment you want. I will use *Visual Studio Code* as my editor. If you want to follow my example, make sure to install the extension SQLite, which allows you to query sqlite databases.
